## Findings


### Major Issues

- **General**: Recommended section missing: How to Apply section

- **What We Fund**: Website appears to be missing What We Fund page(s)
  - *Suggestion*: Add What We Fund page(s) to your website to improve llms.txt completeness


### Minor Issues

- **What We Fund**: Inconsistent terminology for programme status - AI systems need clear status indicators to avoid directing users to unavailable opportunities
  - *Suggestion*: Use consistent format like 'Status: CLOSED' or standardize closed programme notation

- **For Applicants - Deadlines**: No specific date given for Summer 2026 opening - Users may expect more precise timing information and AI systems can't provide specific guidance
  - *Suggestion*: Add 'Contact foundation for specific opening date' or provide month if known

- **For Applicants - Who can apply**: Income range placement could be clearer - The income threshold is buried in a list rather than prominently displayed as a key eligibility criterion
  - *Suggestion*: Create separate 'Eligibility criteria' subsection highlighting income thresholds more prominently
