## Findings


### Critical Issues

- **About**: Required section 'About' is missing
  - *Suggestion*: Add 'About' section with relevant content for your organization

- **Get Help**: Repetitive and unhelpful link descriptions - all links use 'Where our stories live' regardless of their actual purpose - AI systems cannot understand what each link provides, making it impossible to direct users to appropriate resources
  - *Suggestion*: Replace generic descriptions with specific ones like 'Apply for support services', 'Make a donation', 'View impact reports', etc.

- **Get Involved**: Same repetitive 'Where our stories live' descriptions used for involvement/donation links - AI cannot distinguish between different ways to get involved or support the organization
  - *Suggestion*: Use descriptive text like 'Volunteer opportunities', 'Donation options', 'Ways to support our work'


### Major Issues

- **General**: Recommended section missing: About section

- **About**: Section 'About' expected for small charity (£45,062 income)
  - *Suggestion*: Add 'About' section - organizations of your size typically include this

- **Contact**: Section 'Contact' expected for small charity (£45,062 income)
  - *Suggestion*: Add 'Contact' section - organizations of your size typically include this

- **About**: Website appears to be missing About page(s)
  - *Suggestion*: Add About page(s) to your website to improve llms.txt completeness

- **Services**: Website appears to be missing Services page(s)
  - *Suggestion*: Add Services page(s) to your website to improve llms.txt completeness

- **Get Help**: Multiple duplicate links with slight variations (#content anchors) creating confusion - Redundant information makes it harder for AI to determine the canonical resource and may confuse routing decisions
  - *Suggestion*: Consolidate duplicate links and keep only the primary URL for each unique resource

- **Optional**: Blog and privacy policy links use the same generic description - AI systems cannot differentiate between organizational content and legal documents
  - *Suggestion*: Use 'Latest news and stories from our community' for blog and 'Data protection and privacy information' for policy

- **Get Help**: Section title 'Get Help' is misleading as it includes donation and administrative links rather than just support services - AI may incorrectly categorize donation pages as support services, confusing users seeking help
  - *Suggestion*: Rename to 'Resources' or separate into 'Get Support' and 'Other Resources' sections


### Minor Issues

- **Impact**: Impact metrics lack specific numbers or timeframes - AI cannot provide concrete information about the organization's effectiveness or scale of operations
  - *Suggestion*: Add quantitative data where possible, e.g., 'X% of members receiving positive decisions in 2023'


## Website Data Gaps

**Missing Page Types:**

- About
- Services

**Suggested Improvements:**

- Create a dedicated /services or /what-we-do page
- Add a sitemap.xml file to help with content discovery

**Sitemap Detected**: No


## Recommendations

1. Fix 3 critical issue(s): Get Help, Get Involved, About
2. Improve content quality in: Optional, Get Help
3. Website improvements: Create a dedicated /services or /what-we-do page
