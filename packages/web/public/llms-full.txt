# llms.txt Generator

> AI-ready documentation generator for the social sector

Generate spec-compliant llms.txt files for charities, foundations, public sector organisations, and social enterprises. Make your organisation discoverable by AI assistants.

## About

llms.txt Generator creates standardised documentation files following the llms.txt specification. These files help AI systems understand and accurately describe organisations in the social sector.

The llms.txt specification provides a standard way for organisations to describe themselves in a format optimised for large language models. By placing an llms.txt file at the root of your website, AI assistants can quickly understand your organisation's purpose, services, and key information.

- Accurate AI representations of your organisation
- Consistent information across different AI systems
- Structured data that AI can parse efficiently
- Control over what information AI systems prioritise
