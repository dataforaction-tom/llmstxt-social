# llms.txt Generator

> AI-ready documentation generator for the social sector

Generate spec-compliant llms.txt files for charities, foundations, public sector organisations, and social enterprises. Make your organisation discoverable by AI assistants.

## About

llms.txt Generator is a service that creates standardised documentation files following the llms.txt specification. These files help AI systems understand and accurately describe organisations in the social sector.

The llms.txt specification provides a standard way for organisations to describe themselves in a format optimised for large language models. By placing an llms.txt file at the root of your website, AI assistants can quickly understand your organisation's purpose, services, and key information.

### Why llms.txt?

As AI assistants become more prevalent, organisations need a way to ensure they are accurately represented in AI-generated responses. Traditional SEO optimises for search engines, but llms.txt optimises for AI comprehension.

Benefits include:
- Accurate AI representations of your organisation
- Consistent information across different AI systems
- Structured data that AI can parse efficiently
- Control over what information AI systems prioritise

## Features in Detail

### AI-Discoverable Format
Your organisation becomes easy for AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and others to understand and accurately recommend. The structured format ensures consistent representation across different AI systems.

### Spec Compliance
All generated files follow the official llms.txt specification, ensuring maximum compatibility with AI systems that support the standard. The format includes proper markdown structure, section organisation, and metadata.

### Quality Assessment (Paid)
Our AI-powered assessment system analyses your generated llms.txt file for:
- Completeness: Are all recommended sections present?
- Clarity: Is the information easy to parse and understand?
- Accuracy: Does the content match your actual website?
- Specificity: Is there enough detail to be useful?
- Compliance: Does it follow the specification correctly?

Each assessment provides an overall grade (A-F) and detailed findings with recommendations.

### Data Enrichment (Paid)
Automatic integration with official data sources:
- **Charity Commission**: Registration details, financial information, trustees, activities
- **360Giving**: Grant history, funding received, grant amounts

This enrichment adds verified, authoritative data to your llms.txt file.

### Monitoring (Subscription)
Automated monthly checks of your website:
