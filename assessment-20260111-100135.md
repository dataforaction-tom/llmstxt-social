## Findings


### Major Issues

- **Services**: Website appears to be missing Services page(s)
  - *Suggestion*: Add Services page(s) to your website to improve llms.txt completeness

- **About**: Link descriptions are incorrectly labeled - jobs pages described as 'About the organisation' - Misleading labels will confuse AI systems about what information these links contain
  - *Suggestion*: Change job page descriptions to 'Job opportunities' or 'Employment information'

- **Get Help**: All links labeled as 'Contact information' but point to specific events and resources - AI systems will expect contact details but find unrelated content, leading to poor user experience
  - *Suggestion*: Use accurate descriptions like 'Trustee training event', 'Resources section', 'Bid writing course'

- **Get Involved**: Links incorrectly labeled as 'Volunteering opportunities' when they're login pages, events, and resources - Users seeking volunteering opportunities will be directed to inappropriate pages
  - *Suggestion*: Use correct descriptions: 'Member login', 'Events calendar', 'Good practice resources'


### Minor Issues

- **Impact**: Very limited impact data with only 2 metrics provided - Insufficient evidence of organizational effectiveness for funders and stakeholders
  - *Suggestion*: Add more comprehensive impact metrics like number of organizations supported, training participants, funding secured

- **For Funders**: Annual expenditure (£500,631) exceeds annual income (£445,407) without explanation - Could raise concerns about financial sustainability without context
  - *Suggestion*: Add note explaining if this reflects use of reserves or timing differences

- **Services**: Middlesbrough Volunteering Academy description lacks operational details - Key service isn't sufficiently explained for AI systems to properly represent it
  - *Suggestion*: Add details about how the matching process works, types of roles available, support provided


## Website Data Gaps

**Missing Page Types:**

- Services

**Suggested Improvements:**

- Create a dedicated /services or /what-we-do page
- Add a sitemap.xml file to help with content discovery

**Sitemap Detected**: No


## Recommendations

1. Improve content quality in: About, Get Help, Get Involved
2. Website improvements: Create a dedicated /services or /what-we-do page
